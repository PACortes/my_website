## About this Workshop

The aim of this five-day introductory workshop is to guide you through the basics of using `R` via `RStudio` for analysis of institutional data. It is ideal for people new to R or who have limited experience.

I assume no prior coding language for this workshop. My goals are to equip you to work comfortably from the RStudio environment, process, and explore data, and make very nice graphical representations of data.

Specific topics covered include the R environment (directories, workspace, scripts, and packages), data structures (vector, matrix, data frames, lists), and data visualization (scatterplots, boxplots, histograms, etc.).
