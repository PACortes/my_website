<h2>¿What is <code>R</code>?</h2>
<p><code>R</code> is a language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics.</p>
<p>R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.</p>
<p>It is one of the most popular languages used by statisticians, data analysts, researchers and marketers to retrieve, clean, analyze, visualize and present data.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-r-software-environment" class="section level2">
<h2>The <code>R</code> software environment</h2>
<p>The R language programming environment is a fully planned and coherent system built around a standard command-line interface. Users leverage this to read data and load it to the workspace, specify commands and receive results.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-use-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Why use <code>R</code>?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>R is open-source and free!</p></li>
<li><p>R is popular and R community is huge</p></li>
<li><p>R runs on all platforms (Available for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux).</p></li>
<li><p>Publication-quality graphs. With R you have complete control over plotting/graphing options and are able to output publication quality figures with ease.</p></li>
<li><p>Packages for <em>literate statistical programming</em> - weaving written reports and analysis code in one document.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s fun… probably not at the beginning of the learning process.</p></li>

<h2>¿What is <code>RStudio</code>?</h2>
<p><code>RStudio</code> is a free, open source IDE (integrated development environment) for R. Its interface is organized so that the user can clearly view graphs, data tables, R code, and output all at the same time. It also offers an Import-Wizard-like feature that allows users to import <em>CSV</em>, <em>Excel</em>, <em>SAS</em>, <em>SPSS</em> and <em>Stata</em> files into R without having to write the code to do so.</p>
<p>It is important to note that <code>RStudio</code> is a software that runs <code>R</code> and provides additional tools that are useful when writing <code>R</code> code. So <code>R</code> and <code>RStudio</code> are not the same.</p>
</div>
<div id="definitions" class="section level2">
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>The following concepts will be helpful as you begin to explore the <code>R</code> world.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>CRAN</strong>: The Comprehensive R Archive Network is a network of web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R packages</strong>: Extensions to the R programming language. R packages contain code, data, and documentation in a standardised collection format that can be installed by users of R, typically via a centralised software repository such as CRAN. The location where the packages are stored is called the library. If there is a particular functionality that you require, you can download the package from the appropriate site and it will be stored in your library.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Function</strong>: is a set of statements organized together to perform a specific task. R has a large number of in-built functions and the user can create their own functions.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="installing-and-loading-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Installing and Loading Packages</h2>
<p>In order to use a package, it needs to be installed on your computer by running <code>install.packages("name_of_package")</code> (do not forget <code>""</code> around the name of the package).</p>
<p>Once the package is installed, you must load the package and only after it has been loaded you can use all the functions and datasets it contains. To load a package, run <code>library(name_of_package)</code> (this time <code>""</code> around the name of the package are optional).</p>
