## Context
Evaluating university faculty teaching and research performance is necessary for multiple reasons, including assurance of student learning and informing administrative decision-making.

In this workshop, we will use a simulated dataset consisting of faculty employees information. The data set will be use for learning data visualization in R. You can download the database here here[https://www.dropbox.com/s/rsee0jk8v205jba/FacultyAffairs.xlsx?dl=0].
