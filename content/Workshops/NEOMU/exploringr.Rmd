## `R` & `RStudio`?

Let us remember that `R` and `RStudio` are two distinctly different applications that serve different purposes. `R` is the software that performs the actual instructions. It's the workhorse. Without `R` installed on your computer, you would not be able to run any commands. `RStudio` is a software that provides an nifty interface to R.

The largest pane is a console window. This is where you’ll run your R code and see results. The console window is exactly what you’d see if you ran R. Everything else you see is unique to RStudio. Hidden in the other panes are a text editor, a graphics window, a debugger, a file manager, and much more.
