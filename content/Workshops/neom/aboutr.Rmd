# ¿What is `R`?

`R` is a language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.

It is one of the most popular languages used by statisticians, data analysts, researchers and marketers to retrieve, clean, analyze, visualize and present data.

# The `R` software environment

The R language programming environment is a fully planned and coherent system built around a standard command-line interface. Users leverage this to read data and load it to the workspace, specify commands and receive results.

# Why use `R`?

-   R is open-source and free!

-   R is popular and R community is huge

-   R runs on all platforms (Available for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux).

-   Publication-quality graphs. With R you have complete control over plotting/graphing options and are able to output publication quality figures with ease.

-   Packages for *literate statistical programming* - weaving written reports and analysis code in one document.

-   It's fun... probably not at the beginning of the learning process.

# ¿What is `RStudio`?

`RStudio` is a free, open source IDE (integrated development environment) for R. Its interface is organized so that the user can clearly view graphs, data tables, R code, and output all at the same time. It also offers an Import-Wizard-like feature that allows users to import *CSV*, *Excel*, *SAS*, *SPSS* and *Stata* files into R without having to write the code to do so.

It is important to note that `RStudio` is a software that runs `R` and provides additional tools that are useful when writing `R` code. So `R` and `RStudio` are not the same.

# Definitions

The following concepts will be helpful as you begin to explore the `R` world.

-   **CRAN**: The Comprehensive R Archive Network is a network of web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.

-   **R packages**: Extensions to the R programming language. R packages contain code, data, and documentation in a standardised collection format that can be installed by users of R, typically via a centralised software repository such as CRAN. The location where the packages are stored is called the library. If there is a particular functionality that you require, you can download the package from the appropriate site and it will be stored in your library.

-   **Function**: is a set of statements organized together to perform a specific task. R has a large number of in-built functions and the user can create their own functions.

-   **Objects**: R lets you save data by storing it inside an R object. 


# `R` & `RStudio`?

Let us remember that `R` and `RStudio` are two distinctly different applications that serve different purposes. `R` is the software that performs the actual instructions. It's the workhorse. Without `R` installed on your computer, you would not be able to run any commands. `RStudio` is a software that provides an nifty interface to R.

# Installing `R` & `RStudio`

To get started with `R` & `RStudio`, you need to acquire your own copy. Here, I will show you how to download it. Follow the link that describes your operating system: Windows or Mac.

## Window Users
### To install R
-   Open an internet browser and go to [www.r-project.org](www.r-project.org).
-   Click the "download R" link in the middle of the page under "Getting Started."
-   Select a CRAN location (a mirror site) and click the corresponding link.
-   Click on the "Download R for Windows" link at the top of the page.
-   Click on the "install R for the first time" link at the top of the page.
-   Click "Download R for Windows" and save the executable file somewhere on your computer. Run the .exe file and follow the installation instructions.
-   Now that R is installed, you need to download and install RStudio.

### To install RStudio
-   Go to (www.rstudio.com)[www.rstudio.com].
-   Click on [Download] (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and then "Download" under "RStudio Desktop".
-   Click "Download RStudio for Mac" to get the latest Windows version; save the .dmg file on your computer; double-click it to open; and then drag and drop it to your applications folder.


## Mac Users
### To install R
-   Open an internet browser and go to [www.r-project.org](www.r-project.org).
-   Click the "download R" link in the middle of the page under "Getting Started."
-   Select a CRAN location (a mirror site) and click the corresponding link.
-   Click on the "Download R for macOS" link at the top of the page.
-   Click on the file containing the latest version of R, as appropriate for your hardware.
-   Save the .pkg file, double-click it to open, and follow the installation instructions.
-   Now that R is installed, you need to download and install RStudio.

### To install RStudio
-   Go to (www.rstudio.com)[www.rstudio.com].
-   Click on [Download] (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and then "Download" under "RStudio Desktop".
-   Click "Download RStudio for Mac" to get the latest Mac version; save the .dmg file on your computer; double-click it to open; and then drag and drop it to your applications folder.


# Installing and Loading Packages

In order to use a package, it needs to be installed on your computer by running `install.packages("name_of_package")` (do not forget `""` around the name of the package).

Once the package is installed, you must load the package and only after it has been loaded you can use all the functions and datasets it contains. To load a package, run `library(name_of_package)` (this time `""` around the name of the package are optional).
