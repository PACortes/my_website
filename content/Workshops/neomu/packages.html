<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Base packages</h1>
<p>One of Râ€™s attractive features is its rich collection of packages designed for specific applications and techniques.</p>
<p>Packages allow users to share R functions and data with other users.</p>
<p>Some packages come already installed with R, others must be downloaded separately from a CRAN repository or other locations such as GitHub or personal websites.</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-packages-from-cran" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Installing Packages from CRAN</h1>
<p>There are thousands of additional R packages to choose from. Most can be accessed from the CRAN repository.</p>
<p>In order to use a package, it needs to be installed on your computer by running <code>install.packages("name_of_package")</code> (do not forget <code>""</code> around the name of the package).</p>
<p>In the following example, the library ggplot2 is installed from CRAN.</p>
<p><code>install.packages("ggplot2")</code></p>
<p>The installation is usually straightforward and if any other packages need to be installed, RStudio will install those as well as long as the Install dependencies option is checked.</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-packages" class="section level1" number="3">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Loading Packages</h1>
<p>Once the package is installed, or is a base package, you must load the package and only after it has been loaded you can use all the functions and datasets it contains. To load a package, run <code>library(name_of_package)</code> (this time <code>""</code> around the name of the package are optional).</p>
<p>In the following example, the library ggplot2 is loaded.</p>
<p><code>library(ggplot2)</code></p>
