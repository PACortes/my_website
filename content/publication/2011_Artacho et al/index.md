abstract: Cyclically parthenogenetic animals such as aphids are able alternating sexual and asexual reproduction during its life cycle, and represent good models for studying short-term evolutionary consequences of sex. In aphids, different morphs, whether sexual or asexual, winged or wingless, are produced in response to specific environmental cues. The production of these morphs could imply a differential energy investment between the two reproductive phases (i.e., sexual and asexual), which can also be interpreted in terms of changes in genetic variation and/or trade-offs between the associated traits. In this study we compared the G-matrices of energy metabolism, life-history traits and morph production in 10 clonal lineages (genotypes) of the pea aphid, *Acyrthosiphon pisum*, during both sexual and asexual phases. The heritabilities (broad-sense) were significant for almost all traits in both phases; however the only significant genetic correlation we found was a positive correlation between resting metabolic rate and production of winged parthenogenetic females during the asexual phase. These results suggest the pea aphid shows some lineage specialization in terms of energy costs, but a higher specialization in the production of the different morphs (e.g., winged parthenogenetic females). Moreover, the production of winged females during the asexual phase appears to be more costly than wingless females. Finally, the structures of genetic variance-covariance matrices differed between both phases. These differences were mainly due to the correlation between resting metabolic rate and winged parthenogenetic females in the asexual phase. This structural difference would be indicating that energy allocation rules changes between phases, emphasizing the dispersion role of asexual morphs.
