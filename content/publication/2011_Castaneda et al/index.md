abstract: The development of insecticide resistance in pest insects is an increasing problem for agriculture, forestry and public health. Aphids are ubiquitous herbivorous insects, with approximately 4700 known species, of which less than 5% exploit the agricultural environment successfully. Of these, the peach-potato aphid *Myzus persicae* Sulzer is recognized as one of the most important pests worldwide because it has acquired resistance to many insecticides. Although resistance to insecticides provides important benefits for pests in agricultural fields that are treated with insecticides, it may be associated with fitness (or other) costs in environments that are insecticide free. In the present study, the fitness and energy costs that might be experienced by *M. persicae* in an insecticide-free environment when carrying at least one insecticide resistance mutation (IRM), or by having an increased production of esterases, are evaluated. The study investigates whether genotypes that have an IRM also have enhanced esterase production, whether there is any metabolic cost associated with insecticide resistance, and whether there are any fitness costs associated with insecticide resistance and metabolic expenditure. The intrinsic rate of increase, standard metabolic rate (i.e. a measure of maintenance costs) and constitutive esterase activity are determined for 30 different multilocus genotypes carrying (or not carrying) at least one of the two most frequent insecticide resistance mutations (MACE and kdr/super-kdr) that occur in Chile. The results show that genotypes carrying at least one IRM have higher levels of total esterase activity than genotypes without an IRM, that there is no evidence of an energy cost associated with total esterase activity or IRM, and no evidence for a reproductive fitness cost associated with total esterase activity, IRM or metabolic rate. The results agree with previous studies showing linkage disequilibrium between insecticide resistance mechanisms, although they contrast with those of studies that report fitness costs associated with insecticide resistance in *Myzus persicae*.
