abstract: The microbiotherid marsupial *Dromiciops gliroides* inhabits the temperate forests of the Southern hemisphere, facing seasonal nutritional and energetic bottlenecks due to its apparently facultative insectivory/frugivory. In order to understand the physiological processes behind this ecological pattern, we studied the morpho-physiological changes that *D. gliroides* exhibits after dietary acclimation, in a sample of 21 wild-caught individuals fed over 1 month with ad libitum diet of (1) fruit, (2) insects or (3) a mix of insects and fruit. In addition, we measured oxygen consumption (VO(2)) at resting conditions. We also performed enzyme assays (sucrase, maltase, trehalase and aminopeptidase N) and measurements of organ morphology. We found that *D. gliroides* cannot fulfil its nutrient requirements only from insects or fruit. It needs a mixed diet in order to maintain its body mass and energy balance. However, as a response of diet acclimation, individuals showed several-fold changes in the activities of aminopeptidase-N, maltase and sucrase (but not trehalase). This result, both the magnitude of change and the simultaneous effects on three enzymes suggests that *D. gliroides* could exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in the activity of intestinal enzymes. This study suggests also that *D. gliroides*, the only living representative of the Microbiotheria order, exhibits physiological adaptations to a generalist diet.
